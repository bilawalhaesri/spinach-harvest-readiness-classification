# Classification of Hydroponicâ€™s Green Spinach Harvest Readiness Using Image Processing and K-Nearest Neighbors Based on Raspberry Pi
This GitHub repository contains the source code and documentation for a project that aims to improve the efficiency of hydroponic farming by developing a system that classifies the readiness of spinach plants for harvest based on digital image processing techniques. The system uses a webcam to capture images of spinach plants, a Raspberry Pi microcomputer to process the images, and K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify the spinach plants based on their bounding box features and pixel area.
